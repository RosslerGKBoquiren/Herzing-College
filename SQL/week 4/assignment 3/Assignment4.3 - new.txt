5. Add a new column to the "species" table to show the count of each species number 
found in the "animal" table by utilizing the "count_species" function and inserting the appropriate values. 

Then create a trigger that updates this column each time a record is inserted into the "animal" table. 
To test it insert a new record in animal table.

/*The RegExp exec() method, which takes a string as an argument, returns an Array containing all
matches. Consider the following example:*/
var sToMatch = "a bat, a Cat, a fAt baT, a faT cat";
var reAt = /at/;
var arrMatches = reAt.exec(sToMatch);

/*Here, arrMatches contains only one item: the first instance of "at" (which is in the word "bat").
If you want to return all instances of "at", add the g option:*/
var sToMatch = "a bat, a Cat, a fAt baT, a faT cat";
var reAt = /at/g;
var arrMatches = reAt.exec(sToMatch);


/*In this code, arrMatches contains three items: the "at" from "bat", "Cat", and "cat". To return all
instances of at, regardless of the case, just add the i option:*/
var sToMatch = "a bat, a Cat, a fAt baT, a faT cat";
var reAt = /at/gi;
var arrMatches = reAt.exec(sToMatch);

var sToChange = "The sky is red. ";
alert(sToChange.replace("red", "blue")); //outputs "The sky is blue."
/*Here, the substring "red" is replaced with the string "blue", making the output "The sky is blue."
It is possible to pass in a regular expression as the first argument as well:*/
var sToChange = "The sky is red.";
var reRed = /red/;
alert(sToChange.replace(reRed, "blue")); //outputs "The sky is blue. "

/*This code has the same result as the previous example, producing the output "The sky is blue."
You can also specify a function as the second argument of replace(). This function accepts one argument,
the matching text, and returns the text that should replace it. For example:*/
var sToChange = "The sky is red.";
var reRed = /red/;
var sResultText = sToChange.replace(reRed, function(sMatch) {
return "blue";
});
alert(sResultText); //outputs "The sky is blue."

/*The second method is split(), which splits a string into a number of substrings and returns them in an
array, like this:*/
var sColor = "red,blue,yellow,green";
var arrColors = sColor.split(","); //split at each comma

/*The previous code creates an array, arrColors, that contains four items, "red", "blue", "yellow", and
"green'. The same thing can be accomplished using a regular expression instead of the comma:*/
var sColor = "red,blue,yellow,green";
var reComma = /\,/;
var arrColors = sColor.split(reComma); //split at each comma

/*Note the regular expression reComma requires a backslash before the comma character. The comma has
special meaning in regular expression syntax, which you don't intend as its meaning in this case.*/


/*Suppose you want to remove all new line characters from a string (a common task when dealing with
user-input text). You can do so like this:*/
var sNewString = sStringWithNewLines.replace(/\n/g, "");

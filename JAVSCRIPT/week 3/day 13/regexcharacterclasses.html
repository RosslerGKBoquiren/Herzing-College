/*Suppose you want to match "bat", "cat", and "fat". It is very easy to use a simple character class for
this purpose:*/
var sToMatch = "a bat, a Cat, a fAt baT, a faT cat";
var reBatCatRat = /[bcf]at/gi;
var arrMatches = sToMatch.match(reBatCatRat);

/*The arrMatches array is now be filled with these values: "bat", "Cat", "fAt", "baT", "faT", and
"cat". You can also include special characters inside simple classes (and any other type of character
class as well). Suppose you replace the b character with its Unicode equivalent:*/
var sToMatch = "a bat, a Cat, a fAt baT, a faT cat";
var reBatCatRat = /[\u0062cf]at/gi;
var arrMatches = sToMatch.match(reBatCatRat);

/*This code behaves the same as it did in the previous example.*/


/*At times you may want to match all characters except for a select few. In this case, you can use a negation
class, which specifies characters to exclude. For example, to match all characters except a and b, the character
class is [^ab]. The caret (^) tells the regular expression that the character must not match the characters
to follow.*/
/*Going back to the previous example, what if you only wanted to get words containing at but not beginning
with b or c?*/

var sToMatch = "a bat, a Cat, a fAt baT, a faT cat";
var reBatCatRat = /[^bc]at/gi;
var arrMatches = sToMatch.match(reBatCatRat);

/*In this case, arrMatches contains "fAt" and "faT", because these strings match the pattern of a
sequence ending with at but not beginning with b or c.*/

Create a page with a text area, two text boxes, and a button.
The user then types a paragraph into the textarea.
The text boxes will take the word the user wants to find, and then the word the user wants to replace it with.
The user presses a button, and all words that match the search word will be replaced with the replacement word.
If a word isn't found, alert the user that the word wasn't found, and no changes were made.
If the word is found, alert the user telling them what word was replaced with the replacement word.

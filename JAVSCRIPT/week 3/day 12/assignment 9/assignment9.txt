Create an HTML file with the necessary elements:
Five progress bars represent the cars.

A "Start Race" button to initiate the race.
JavaScript Logic:

Create a JavaScript file linked to the HTML.
Define variables to store references to HTML elements (e.g., progress bars, dropdown).
Implement a function to start the race when the "Start Race" button is clicked and generate a random speed for each car.
.
Within the race function:
Start a loop to continuously update the progress of each car until one reaches the finish line.
Update the progress bars accordingly based on the random speed generated for each car.
Stop the cars (progress bars) when they reach the finish line.
Event Handling:

Attach event listeners to the "Start Race" button to trigger the race function.
Handle user input for selecting the car to bet on.
Styling (Optional):

Apply CSS to style the progress bars and other elements to resemble a racing track.
Add visual effects to enhance the user experience during the race.

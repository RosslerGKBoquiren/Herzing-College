    //you can put script tags anywhere in the document
    //just make sure they are in the right loading order 
    //or you are using the document.ready event.

    //the attribute 'type="text/javascript"' was required prior to HTML5
    //but this is no longer the case, and you can just use the script tags
    //without the attribute.

    //here are some basic variables in javascript, declared with the 'var' keyword
    var num1 = prompt("number 1", 0);//5;  //using a prompt to ask the user for a value
    var num2 = prompt("number 2", 0);//7;  //using a prompt to ask the user for a value

    var total = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2); //try removing parseInt function to see what happens.

    //Keep an eye on tabs for document structure in JavaScript
    //tabs help to keep things organized.
    //A lot of times we want to manipulate data from elements on a page.

    //In order to access elements on the page we should use the window.onload event, 
    //and assign a function to it. 
    window.onload = function (){
        //store an element in a variable
        var content = document.getElementById("contentId");
        
        //change the contents of the html in the tag.
        content.innerHTML = total;
        
        //access style properties to make real time changes.
        content.style.backgroundColor = "black";
        content.style.width = "500px";
    }

    //if we want to do something when a button is clicked, we can create a function and then 
    //call it from the button, or assign it to the button.
</script>
    
    <div id="contentId" style="color:red;font-size:32px;">
        <!-- The total will end up here. -->

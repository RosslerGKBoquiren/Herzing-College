All assignments will be marked according to the 5 point rubric unless otherwise specified by the assignment. Larger assignments and tests will have a different marking scheme. All submitted assignments are weighted equally.
Participation in class and reading and exercise work in all books in the course is expected.

5 Point Rubric:
----------------------------------
2 pts works and looks as intended
1 pt clean code
1 pt comments/documentation
1 pt understanding/completion

half points can be earned.

Assignments will be due next class for the smaller assignments earlier on in the module.

Other, longer assignments can be given an extension if necessary, as in PHP and JAVA, as they sometimes depending on circumstances projects can be drawn out. 

End of the week time is there for finishing up assignments, reading and exercises and wrapping up the week, and reviewing materials.

Weekly Assignments in Java will be due at the end of the week, unless otherwise specified, as these applications take more planning and careful consideration.

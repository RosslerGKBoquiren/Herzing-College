Part 2 (5 pts).
Create a function in php called calculate() which takes three variables, $number1 and $number2, and an optional variable called $operator. Set $operator to have a default value of "a" for addition but allow the user to use the value "s" for subtraction, "d" for division and "m" for multiplication. Return the value that is calculated from the function and output the results to the screen.

Output should look like:

Number 1 = 36
Number 2 = 42
Operator = "a"
Result = 78
